Visual Studio is the IDE I use for making my ASP.NET Core and C# applications. I feel when I mainly use my keyboard instead of the mouse, my productivity increases and it feels I can keep the thought train going, which is essential in the creative process of programming. Hotkeys and shortcuts are therefore important to incorporate in your way of working. Although it is a time investment, it's definately worth it.

*Productivity increases when focussing on using solely the keyboard during development after some time invested.*

Hereby a list of short cuts I use daily. I want to highlight two shortcuts that were important to me going 'mouseless':

* ```ctrl + t``` to quickly access classes and files, where you can use each capital letter of `CamelCase` (cc) to quickly find what you are looking for.
* ```ctrl + tab``` to quickly navigate between views and files.

## View
