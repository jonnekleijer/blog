I am a software engineer for products of [AquaSuite](https://aquasuite.ai/en/) at [HaskoningDHV](https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/). I started making software since 2017. My focus is making software incorporating data analysis for the water sector. My goals for this blog is to:
* Formulate techniques and concepts in my own words to make my thinking more explicit.
* .

## Software developer @ Aquasuite
*2020*  
*.NET, C#, Azure, TypeScript, Angular*


My passion for software development grew, I wanted to move to a product team, where I could focus on one product and be more exposed to seniors developers. I joined the team of [AquaSuite](https://aquasuite.ai/en/). This is where we write software for the drinking and waste water industry. My contribution is focussed on the development of a scalable application for time series analysis in the water sector.


## Geo ICT @ WaterManagement HaskoningDHV
*2017-2020*  
*Python, SQL, Django, Postgres, PostGIS, ArcGIS, JS*


Just before this job I took a few months off to learn Python and focussed on data analysis. As I could show my new acquired skills, I could begin as a Geo ICT'er. During these 3 years I was exposed to several applications and software teams. To name a few:
* Water Management Group: Post processing of 3D groundwater and surface models
* Nationale Regen Radar: Calibration of rainfall raders and measurements
* Nereda: Parametric design of water treatment plants
* BlueLabel: Calculate labels for the risk on water damage for the build environment


## Drinking water engineer
*2014-2017*  
*Python, SQL*


For three years, I worked at [Vitens Evides International](https://www.vei.nl/). I was located in Bangladesh, one of my favorite countries. The continuing battle against water made it a facinating country to be part of. It drains most of the Himalayas and therefore is this huge deltic area, with all its riverine systems. 

During my time there I mainly supported the drinking water utility, Dhaka WASA. My role was threefold:
* Guide the implemenation and operations of a simple SCADA system
* Support the geo information department with tools and training
* Provide low income communities with improved sanitation and drinking water services


## Civil Engineering and GeoSciences
*2009-2014*  
*Matlab, Fortran*


As a young boy I was interested in the water sector and building stuff. My interest for the water sector originated from spending a lot of time on the water with my grandparents. It made sense study Civil Engineering and I mastered in Utrecht on the track Coastal Dyanmics and Fluvial Systems afterwards. During my study I was drawn to fiddling with data, new software packages and automation.
